# POMODORO for FreeCodeCamp Frontend Frameworks

Hi, there! This is my pomodoro timer app that fully meets the requirements of FCC, Frontend Frameworks, project 5. This is the final project. I have mainly used react and redux for the project.

I included the bundle just for hosting purposes.

To run the website, you can simply install live server, do live server on index.html.

If you make changes to source code, run 

```npm run build```

If you make changes to the scss file, after changes, run

```npm run build-css```
